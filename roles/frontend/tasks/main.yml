  The frontend is the service in RobotShop to serve the web content over Nginx.
  
  To Install Nginx.
  
  # yum install nginx -y
  # systemctl enable nginx 
  # systemctl start nginx 
  Let's download the HTDOCS content and deploy under the Nginx path.
  
  # curl -s -L -o /tmp/frontend.zip "https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/frontend/archive/main.zip"
  Deploy in Nginx Default Location.
  
  # cd /usr/share/nginx/html
  # rm -rf * 
  # unzip /tmp/frontend.zip
  # mv frontend-main/* .
  # mv static/* .
  # rm -rf frontend-master README.md
  # mv localhost.conf /etc/nginx/default.d/roboshop.conf
  Finally restart the service once to effect the changes.

# systemctl restart nginx
